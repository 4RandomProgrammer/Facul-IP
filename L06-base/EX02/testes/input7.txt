Oh, ow! And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Well, she turned me into a newt. You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!

Well, we did do the nose. I'm not a witch. Bring her forward! We want a shrubbery!! The nose? Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

What do you mean? The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.

...Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! Where'd you get the coconuts? You don't vote for kings.

The nose? I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!

A newt? Camelot! Shut up! Will you shut up?! Well, how'd you become king, then? Be quiet! Burn her anyway!

We want a shrubbery!! And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. I have to push the pram a lot. And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Camelot! Well, how'd you become king, then?

The most astounding fact [about the universe] is
the knowledge that the atoms that comprise life on Earth, the
atoms that make up the human body, are traceable to the
crucibles that cooked light elements into heavy elements in
their core under extreme temperatures and pressures.

These stars, the high mass ones among them, went unstable
in their later years. They collapsed and then exploded,
scattering their enriched guts across the galaxy---guts made
of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and all the fundamental
ingredients of life itself.

These ingredients become part of gas clouds that condense,
collapse, form the next generation of solar systems, stars with
orbiting planets, and those planets now have the ingredients
for life itself, so that when I look up at the night sky and I
know that yes, we are part of this universe, we are in this
universe, but perhaps more important than both of those
facts is that the universe is in us.

When I reflect on that fact, I look up, many people feel small
because they're small and the Universe is big, but I feel big,
because my atoms came from those stars.

There's a level of connectivity. That's really what you want in
life. You want to feel connected. You want to feel relevant.
You want to feel like you are a participant in the goings on of
activities and events around you. That's precisely what we
are just by being alive.
